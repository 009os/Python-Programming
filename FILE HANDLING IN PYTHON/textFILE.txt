According to data, the second wave is 1.7x times faster than the first wave; in other words, it has taken 51 days to 
reach a daily caseload of 84,000 from 11,000, as against 85 days taken in the first wave. These analyses suggest that 
the situation is not at all better but, in fact, it could result in more deaths in less time, putting greater pressure on the
health infrastructure than last year. Doctors and experts said that several factors are responsible for Covid deaths, 
including delays in detection, the nature of treatment, and the age of the infected person. Some also said that less 
severe symptoms are being observed this time around.
